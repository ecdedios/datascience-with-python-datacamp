# About
> Just another repo for the code I use on Datacamp's Data Science with Python track. Yes, I've decided to add another 100 hours on Data Science on top of Codeup's training; just making sure everything sticks!

**UPDATE:** I've decided to do a shorter skill track instead. I went for that small win to keep me motivated.
